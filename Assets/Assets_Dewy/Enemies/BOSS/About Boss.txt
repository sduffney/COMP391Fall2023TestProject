Hi!
-I had to separate the Boss' animations because the grid sizes where different, sorry for the inconvenience.
-You can use "Tongue_Attack_Divided_32x32" to make the attack as large as you want.
-----Tip-----
You can repeat the last frame of the death animation to make it stay longer on the floor.
